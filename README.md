# Sign-To-Speech
Using TensorFlow to translate Sign to speech in real-time! **Sahayak Hackathon 2020**

## Problem
People who have vocal and hearing disablities can not communicate in online meetings and video calls during Work From Home. This can lead them to loss of employment.

## Solution
The solution is to enable to the people with vocal and hearing disablities to take part in online video meetings by using **Sign language to speech conversion**. The person with disablities can use any sign language that he/she wants (Eg., Indian Sign Language) or even a sign language of his/her own. The system should be trained only once and then , the specially abled person can use sign language to communicate during meetings. The receiver in the other end automatically gets a machine generated voice.

## Technical Feasibility
Our product speaks about this :D We are satisfied with the outcome of the product as we took barely 5-6 hours in developing this during #SahayakHackathon. We strongly believe that this product can be deployed in the market and this can empower people with vocal/hearing disabilities.
